Diskspace
=========

.. tip::

   You are most likely reading this page because you have received a diskspace notification from us.
   Here you can find information about what this means for you.

We monitor the diskspace and inform you as soon you are using more diskspace than you have chosen in the cockpit.
In the meanwhile, additional resources are claimed, which only are provided as buffers.
We therefore reserve the right to increase storage space automatically if the reserve is used up or if you not responding within the deadline.

Tools
=====

You can run these tools by login with the devop user (see :ref:`access_devop`).

* ``diskusage``: Starts `ncdu <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ncdu>`__, a disk space utility with which you can find large files or directories.
* ``df -Th /``: Look at the "Used" column. This value must be below the value set in the cockpit.

FAQ
===

Which data belong to my diskspace?
----------------------------------

Shortly: All data stored on the disk.

* This includes all data you see with ``diskusage``. This contains your web project, your databases, your docker containers, the underlying Linux and all other data stored on the disk.
* And: The daily file system snapshots are also counted among your diskspace. These are stored in ``/snapshot``, but are not displayed in ``diskusage``.

How much storage space do the daily snapshots use?
--------------------------------------------------

For the daily file system snapshot (see :ref:`backup`) only the changed data occupies storage.
Depending on the use of the server, the consumption therefore varies.

.. tip::
   Example: Assuming you change 1GB of data every day, the snapshots then need 1GB every day (1GB x 30 days = 30GB in a month).

Technically we use btrfs for the file system snapshots.
Unfortunately it is not possible to show how much disk space all snapshots need in total,
which is due to the way btrfs works (Copy on Write).

However, you can calculate the actual consumption by subtracting the total of ``df -Th /`` from ``diskusage``.
The difference is used for the snapshots.

I have deleted many files. But the diskspace has not changed.
-------------------------------------------------------------

All files you delete are still present in the snapshots and therefore still occupy disk space.
By default, snapshots are kept for 30 days, so the storage space usage of deleted files is visible in 30 days.

Can I delete snapshots?
-----------------------

No. In most cases it would not help much either.
The cleaned up or deleted files are in most cases older than 30 days and therefore referenced in all snapshots.
So we would have to delete all snapshots, which also affects the backup (see :ref:`backup`).

We recommend adjusting the diskspace in the cockpit and checking it again in 30 days.
